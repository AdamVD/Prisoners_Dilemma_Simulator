<h1>Prisoner's Dilemma Simulator 1.1.0</h1>
<h4>An evolutionary simulator for the iterative prisoner's dilemma.</h4>

<p>
  This project was created to simulate the iterative <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma">prisoner's dilemma</a>
  with an evolutionary <em>survival of the fittest</em> approach. The design of the simulator focuses on the ease of creating new prisoner
  algorithms and plugging them into the simulation; this simplicity has finally been realized in the most recent version.
   For more information about how to use the simulator, visit the <a href="https://github.com/AdamVD/Prisoners_Dilemma_Simulator/wiki">Wiki.</a>

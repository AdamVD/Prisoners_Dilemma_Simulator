<h1>Prisoner's Dilemma Simulator</h1>
<h4>An evolutionary simulator for the iterative prisoner's dilemma.</h4>

<p>
  This project was created to simulate the iterative <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma">prisoner's dilemma</a>
  with an evolutionary <em>survival of the fittest</em> approach. The design of the simulator focuses on the ease of creating new prisoner
  algorithms, and plugging them into the simulation with little effort. In its initial state the effort required to introduce a new prisoner
  algorithm to the simulator is still too high. The goal is to make hot-swapping prisoner algorithms as simple as changing the algorithm 
  names in a collection. For more information about how the simulator works, visit the <a href="https://github.com/AdamVD/Prisoners_Dilemma_Simulator/wiki">Wiki.</a>
